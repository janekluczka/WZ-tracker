# WZ-Tracker

**WZ-Tracker** is an application dedicated to the now-discontinued *Call of Duty Warzone* and *Call of Duty: Warzone Caldera*. The primary goal of this project is to provide users with an easy-to-use tool for tracking their latest games and overall statistics within the game. By utilizing the Call of Duty username, the app connects to **RapidAPI** using **Retrofit** to retrieve the user's latest 20 games and their overall stats.

Please note that this project has been abandoned as the developer lost interest in the game. Feel free to use the existing codebase or contribute to it if you find it useful.

## Features

- **Game Tracking**: WZ-Tracker allows users to track their latest 20 games, providing insights into their gaming performance.
- **Overall Stats**: Get a comprehensive overview of your overall statistics, helping you analyze and improve your gameplay.
- **RapidAPI Integration**: The app seamlessly integrates with RapidAPI, leveraging Retrofit to retrieve up-to-date game data.
