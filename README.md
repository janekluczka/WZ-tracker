# WZ-Tracker

**WZ-Tracker** is an application dedicated to the now-discontinued *Call of Duty Warzone* and *Call of Duty: Warzone Caldera*. The primary goal of this project is to provide users with an easy-to-use tool for tracking their latest games and overall statistics within the game. By utilizing the user's Activision ID, the app connects to **RapidAPI** using **Retrofit** to retrieve the user's latest 20 games and their overall stats.

## Features

- **Game Tracking**: WZ-Tracker allows users to track their latest 20 games, providing insights into their gaming performance.
- **Overall Stats**: Get a comprehensive overview of your overall statistics, helping you analyze and improve your gameplay.
- **RapidAPI Integration**: The app seamlessly integrates with RapidAPI, leveraging Retrofit to retrieve up-to-date game data. For more information, visit the [RapidAPI Call of Duty Modern Warfare API](https://rapidapi.com/elreco/api/call-of-duty-modern-warfare).
